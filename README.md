# Smart Task Analyzer

A mini-application that intelligently scores and prioritizes tasks based on multiple factors including urgency, importance, effort, and dependencies. This project demonstrates problem-solving ability, algorithmic thinking, and clean code practices.

## 🎯 Features

- **Multiple Scoring Strategies**: Choose from 4 different prioritization algorithms
  - **Smart Balance**: Intelligently balances all factors (recommended)
  - **Fastest Wins**: Prioritizes low-effort tasks for quick wins
  - **High Impact**: Prioritizes importance over everything else
  - **Deadline Driven**: Prioritizes based on due date urgency

- **Intelligent Algorithm**: Considers multiple factors:
  - **Urgency**: Days until due date (with exponential penalty for overdue tasks)
  - **Importance**: User-provided rating (1-10 scale)
  - **Effort**: Estimated hours (lower effort = higher priority for quick wins)
  - **Dependencies**: Tasks that block other tasks get higher priority

- **Edge Case Handling**:
  - Past due dates with exponential penalty
  - Missing or invalid data validation
  - Circular dependency detection
  - Graceful error handling

- **Modern UI**: Clean, responsive interface with:
  - Form-based and JSON input modes
  - Visual priority indicators (color-coded)
  - Detailed explanations for each priority score
  - Real-time task preview

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Decisions

### Algorithm Design

The core challenge was designing a scoring function that intelligently weighs multiple competing factors. Here's how each strategy works:

#### Smart Balance (Default Strategy)

This is the most sophisticated algorithm, using dynamic weighting based on context:

1. **Urgency Calculation**:
   - Past due: Exponential penalty (100 + days_overdue × 2.5, capped at 200)
   - Due today: 100 points
   - Due tomorrow: 90 points
   - Due in 2-3 days: 75 points
   - Due in a week: 60 points
   - Due in 2 weeks: 45 points
   - Due in a month: 30 points
   - Far future: 15 points

2. **Dynamic Weighting**:
   - **Overdue tasks**: Urgency weight = 2.5, Importance = 1.0, Effort = 0.3
   - **Due soon (≤3 days)**: Urgency = 1.5, Importance = 1.2, Effort = 0.5
   - **Normal**: Urgency = 1.0, Importance = 1.0, Effort = 0.8

3. **Dependency Boost**: Tasks that block other tasks get +20 points per blocked task

4. **Effort Score**: Inverted (lower hours = higher score): `50 / (hours + 1)`

**Why this approach?**
- Overdue tasks need immediate attention, so urgency dominates
- Soon-due tasks balance urgency with importance
- Normal tasks balance all factors for optimal productivity
- Dependencies ensure blocking tasks are prioritized

#### Fastest Wins Strategy

Prioritizes low-effort tasks:
- Effort score: `100 / (hours + 1)` (primary factor)
- Urgency: 30% weight
- Importance: Linear scaling

**Use case**: When you need quick momentum or have many small tasks.

#### High Impact Strategy

Prioritizes importance:
- Importance: `importance × 20` (primary factor)
- Dependency boost: `+15 per blocked task`
- Urgency: 40% weight

**Use case**: When strategic value matters more than deadlines.

#### Deadline Driven Strategy

Prioritizes urgency:
- Urgency: `urgency × 2.0` (primary factor)
- Importance: `importance × 3.0`
- Effort bonus: `20 - hours` (prefers lower effort when urgency is similar)

**Use case**: When deadlines are critical and non-negotiable.

### Edge Case Handling

1. **Past Due Dates**: Exponential penalty ensures overdue tasks are always prioritized, but doesn't let extremely old tasks dominate forever (capped at 200).

2. **Missing Data**: 
   - Missing due date: Moderate urgency (30 points)
   - Missing importance: Defaults to 5 (neutral)
   - Missing estimated_hours: Defaults to 8 (average)

3. **Circular Dependencies**: 
   - Detected using DFS algorithm
   - Tasks in cycles are flagged with warnings
   - Still processed but user is informed

4. **Invalid Data**: 
   - Comprehensive validation before scoring
   - Returns error messages instead of crashing
   - Graceful degradation

### Code Quality Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - `scoring.py`: Pure algorithm logic (testable, reusable)
   - `views.py`: API layer (handles HTTP, validation)
   - Frontend: Presentation layer (UI, user interaction)

2. **Type Hints**: Used throughout for better code clarity and IDE support

3. **Error Handling**: 
   - Validation at multiple levels (frontend + backend)
   - Meaningful error messages
   - No silent failures

4. **Documentation**: 
   - Docstrings for all functions
   - Inline comments for complex logic
   - README with design rationale

## 🧪 Testing Edge Cases

The system handles various edge cases:

1. **Past Due Dates**: Try a task with `due_date: "2020-01-01"` - it will get high priority
2. **Missing Fields**: Tasks with missing optional fields are handled gracefully
3. **Circular Dependencies**: Try tasks with circular dependencies - warnings will appear
4. **Invalid Data**: Invalid dates, out-of-range importance, etc. are validated
